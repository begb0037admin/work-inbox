# work-inbox — Living Handover Document

**Last updated:** 2026-07-03 — brief session aborted (GitHub MCP disconnected). No code changes. Two items added to fix list.
**Status:** Active — pipeline fully working. Live at https://wi.lelitte.co.uk/ | https://begb0037admin.github.io/work-inbox/.

---

## NEXT SESSION — Fix list (priority order)

1. **Absences not showing tomorrow's absences** — Sidebar absences panel is blank even when a team member (e.g. Michael) is on leave tomorrow. The `fetch_inbox.py` triage needs to detect upcoming absences — at minimum from calendar events and sent/received emails — and include them in `briefing.json` `absences[]` with enough forward notice (at least 1 day prior). Investigate what data is currently being pulled into `absences[]` and why tomorrow's absences are missing.

2. **AI calendar summaries are too generic and not intelligent** — Current summaries are boilerplate ("Address any concerns or feedback") with no context from prior meetings. Required behaviour:
   - For **1-1s** (e.g. Asta, Michael, James): pull the most recent 1-1 Granola transcript for that person, identify what was last discussed, and surface the key carry-forward items as the summary. Example: Michael is on annual leave tomorrow — the summary for today's Michael 1-1 should have flagged "handover before leave" as the priority, not generic performance talk.
   - For **recurring reviews** (e.g. HR Systems Roadmap): pull the last Roadmap meeting from Granola, identify open actions or blockers, and summarise the current status of the most important item.
   - The AI should use Granola meeting history as context — this requires `fetch_inbox.py` to query the Granola API (already available in the ecosystem via `mcp__Granola__*` tools) and pass relevant prior-meeting context into the triage prompt.
   - This is a significant enhancement to `fetch_inbox.py` Phase 2 — plan carefully before coding.

3. **Drag reorder animation** — No visual feedback during drag. Kevin needs cards to visually shift in real time as he drags: card below flips up as he drags down, card above moves down as he drags up. Requires rewriting drag handlers to insert a live placeholder into the DOM during `dragover`. Meaningful piece of work — plan before coding.

4. **Add Oxford crest hard rule to all repo CLAUDE.md files** — Identified 2026-07-03. The hard rule protecting the crest only existed in work-inbox CLAUDE.md. Needs propagating to hris-launcher (`<img class="sidebar-crest">`), command-centre (`<img class="sb-crest">`), and hr-fa-knowledge-base (`<img class="crest">`). hris-dashboard uses an emoji; ag-flexpoints has no crest.

5. **Verify no crests showing grey squares on live dashboards** — Source inspection on 2026-07-03 confirmed all base64 crests had valid JPEG headers, but visual verification on live dashboards still needed before closing this item.

## Session 2026-07-03 (aborted — GitHub MCP disconnected)

GitHub MCP server disconnected before handover could be pushed. No code changes this session. Reminder trigger set for 2026-07-04 07:00 UTC (subsequently deleted when session resumed manually on 2026-07-04). Two new items identified and added to fix list: crest rule propagation (#4) and grey square verification (#5).

---

## Session 2026-07-02 (end) — small fixes pushed to main

- **`ctx-strip` label restored** — `setupCtxTicker()` was missing `<div class="ctx-label">Briefing context</div>`. Added back. Commit `fb178b5`.
- **Badge position fixed** — NEW/UPDATED badges moved from inside `.card-ph-title` to `.card-ph-actions` (right side, next to CC→). Commit `2d39b9e`. Confirmed working.
- **OSM IT Services URL** — sidebar link updated to `https://oxford.saasiteu.com/Modules/SelfService/#home`. Commit `e4cc1fd`.

---

## Session 2026-07-02 (continued) — calendar panel corrections

Commits pushed to main: `af12dff` (equal 3-col, July+August, AI summaries), `1da688d` (combined mini-cals into one card, narrowed calendar column).

### What changed
- **`css/styles.css`**: `.main-cal-panel` grid changed to `7fr 7fr 4fr` — Today and Tomorrow take equal wider columns; mini-cal column is narrower (≈22% of row).
- **`js/app.js`**: `renderMiniCal(monthOffset)` now returns inner content only (no wrapping block). Both months rendered inside a single `.main-cal-block` with a `.mini-cal-divider` `<hr>` between them. AI summaries (`c.summary`) shown on Today/Tomorrow entries as `.main-cal-summary` divs.

---

## Session 2026-07-02 — v5 design corrections (commit `12ff90d`)

- **Removed** email address from sidebar
- **Links updated**: 6 approved links, all now populated (OSM IT Services = `https://oxford.saasiteu.com/Modules/SelfService/#home`)
- **Cards redesigned**: flat `.card-ph` design (drag handle, circle done button, title + sub, email + CC→ icons, NEW/UPDATED badges on right)
- **Layout corrected**: left col = Today + Tomorrow, right col = Week + Parked
- **Oxford crest**: restored as external file `images/oxford-crest.jpg` — NEVER embed as base64, NEVER delete, NEVER change the `src` attribute

---

## Session 2026-07-02 — v5 full redesign (PR #24)

Three files changed: `index.html`, `css/styles.css`, `js/app.js`. Approved by Kevin, cherry-picked to main throughout session.

**`js/app.js`** — functions added: `renderCalPanel`, `setupCtxTicker`, `_renderCtx`, `_jumpCtx`, `updateInboxWidget`, `applyFilter`, `clearSel`, `clickStat`, `loadCcTicker`. `renderBriefing()` updated. `loadTasksWidget()` replaced by `loadCcTicker()`.

All existing mechanics preserved: drag/drop, openmail://, tick sync, archive, show done, priority overrides.

---

## Session 2026-06-29 — Task Scheduler re-established

- Re-established via `create_inbox_tasks.bat` (repo root). Run as Administrator.
- Schedule: `WorkInbox-0900` / `WorkInbox-1200` / `WorkInbox-1500` Mon–Fri.

---

## Session 2026-06-28 — Live clock added to sidebar

- `updateWiClock()` + `setInterval` added to `js/app.js`. Merged to main via PR #20.

---

## Session 2026-06-27 — File split + Cloudflare custom domain

- 65KB monolithic `index.html` split into `index.html` (shell) + `css/styles.css` + `js/app.js`.
- `wi.lelitte.co.uk` live via Cloudflare. Auto-deploys from main.

## Architecture

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `fetch_inbox.py` | Outlook COM via pywin32. Pulls inbox → Anthropic triage (claude-haiku-4-5) → pushes `data/briefing.json` to GitHub via Contents API |
| `index.html` | Shell — HTML structure only. Loads `css/styles.css` → `js/app.js`. No framework, no build step. |
| `css/styles.css` | All styles. |
| `js/app.js` | All JS — briefing render, cal panel, ctx ticker, CC ticker, drag-and-drop, tick sync, archive, live clock. |
| `open_email.py` | Registered `openmail://` protocol handler — opens exact email in classic Outlook via EntryID COM |

---

## Current State

### Working
- fetch_inbox.py — all phases confirmed working
- Task Scheduler — `WorkInbox-0900` / `WorkInbox-1200` / `WorkInbox-1500` (Mon–Fri). Recovery: run `create_inbox_tasks.bat` as Administrator.
- Dashboard loads live briefing.json on load, falls back to localStorage archive
- Oxford navy sidebar — crest (external `images/oxford-crest.jpg`), branding, live clock, filter, CC ticker, inbox widget, absences, all 6 links populated
- 3-column calendar panel (Today `7fr` | Tomorrow `7fr` | July+August mini-cals in one card `4fr`)
- Rotating context strip with "Briefing context" label, dot nav
- 2×2 priority grid with tier filter — flat `.card-ph` design, NEW/UPDATED badges on right
- CC ticker reads live from CC tasks.json every 60s
- drag-and-drop, tick sync, archive, show done, openmail:// all working
- Multi-machine setup complete (begb0037.AD-OAK)

### Known issues (fix next session)
- Absences not showing tomorrow's leave — see fix list above
- AI calendar summaries too generic — needs Granola context — see fix list above
- Drag reorder has no visual animation — see fix list above

### Critical Note — Desktop Bat File
- **Never rename** — always download fresh via PowerShell:
  `Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/begb0037admin/work-inbox/main/Run_Inbox_Briefing.bat" -OutFile "$env:USERPROFILE\Desktop\Run Inbox Briefing.bat"`

## localStorage Keys

| Key | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `workInbox_briefings_v1` | Archive of past briefing JSON objects, keyed by date string |
| `workInbox_today_v1` | Key of the currently displayed briefing |
| `workInbox_ticks_v1` | Tick (done) state for all cards |
| `workInbox_priOverrides_v1` | Per-card section overrides for priority drag-and-drop |
| `workInbox_priOrder_v1` | Per-section sort order for priority cards |
| `workInbox_customPri_v1` | Email cards manually dragged into priority sections |

---

## Technical Notes

**index.html edits:** always use binary `atob()`/`btoa()` — NEVER `TextEncoder` on file content (re-encodes em-dash bytes).

**Priority drag-and-drop sections:** `pt` (today), `ptom` (tomorrow), `pw` (week), `pfyi` (parked/FYI), `ur` (urgent overlay), `nr` (needs overlay).

## Standing Rules
- Never commit tokens or raw data
- All GitHub writes via Contents API (PAT from `GITHUB_PAT` env var)
- `index.html` edits: always use binary `atob()`/`btoa()` — NEVER `TextEncoder`
- Desktop bat: always download fresh via PowerShell — never rename an existing file
- Every raw.githubusercontent.com fetch MUST include `?t=<timestamp>` cache-buster
- **NEVER touch `images/oxford-crest.jpg` or the `<img class="sidebar-crest">` src attribute** — external file only, never base64
